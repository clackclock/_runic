# _runic
A framework for making magic spells with code.

# Overview
Basically, it translates javascript statements and methods into parts of a casting cirle/ rune. Whatever code you type will be parsed and a casting rune will appear representing your spell/ program. 

To give it more of a handwritten-tome-like vibe [Rough.js]("roughjs.com") is being used for the images and canvas capabilities. 

Some shapes and code will be made in advance to add to the immersion of the site
Example:
- Fireball() = .remove or a delete all button
- Summon() = add to an array or matrix

Most likely another JavaScript framework with extra steps.
